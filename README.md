# <p align="center">Hello, I'm Adam</p>
<p>
I used to wrangle code as a developer, but now I wrangle products as a Data Product Manager. In my spare time, I code and experiment with projects that reflect my interests across data science, engineering, analytics, and cybersecurity. Whether you're here to check out my work or collaborate, I'm always up for connecting with new people.

## My Work
- Data Science Projects: TBD
- Data Analytics Projects: TBD
- Data Engineering Projects: TBD

## Connect With Me
