# <p align="center">Hello, I'm Adam</p>
<p>
I used to spend my days writing code as a developer, but now I focus on products as a Data Product Manager. In my free time, I still love to tinker with code, exploring projects that dive into data science, engineering, analytics, and sometimes a bit of cybersecurity. Whether you're here to see my work, chat, or maybe collaborate on something, I’m happy to connect.
</p>

## Current Focus
By day, I’m a Data Product Manager, and on the side, I’m currently working on a few small data engineering projects, exploring the world of LLMs, and reading up on data governance.
